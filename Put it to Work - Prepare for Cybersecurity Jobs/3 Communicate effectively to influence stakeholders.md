## Feedback

A pretty good balance between Google products & other products is met. For example, when discussing spreadsheets, Google Sheets and Apache OpenOffice.

However, this module was one of the weakest, it was extremely basic generic office stuff. Presumably it helps some people, but if a person is capable of learning Python, Linux, and SQL throughout this, they can figure out a Google Sheet!

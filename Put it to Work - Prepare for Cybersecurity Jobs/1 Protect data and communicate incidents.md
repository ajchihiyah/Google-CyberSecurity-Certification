## Feedback

AGAIN with the very slow talking! The dramatic pauses etc make it sound like there's some technical playback issues or something, truly baffling. I assume it's to ease understanding for those without native English, but... there are playback speed options and subtitles?

The entire course has been at 1.5x, and anything below 1.25x doesn't sound normal.

This module was a very short recap of past content, plus vague information on security mindset etc.

"I hope you enjoyed our discussion as much as I did!"...
